# LULU-DODGE-space-dodge-but-with-a-cat-
This is my first game as a beginner and a personal project based on the classic Space Dodge with a twist. Our cat, Lulu, was prescribed medication for depression, but she hates taking it. In the game, the spaceship represents Lulu, and the falling stars are her medicine—which she’s trying her best to dodge and avoid at all costs!
